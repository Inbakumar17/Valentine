    <h2>My Message For You ❤️</h2>
    <p class="letter-text">Nandhini, Happy Valentine’s Day, my love ❤️ I’m happy that I met you in my life and even more happy when you chose me 💗🫳🏻 I love you, papa 💕 I can’t meet you, send you gifts, or take you out even on this day, but it’s just another day of missing you 🫂💖. This is a special day to show love to loved ones and make them feel special ✨️. For me, you’re always special, and I always want to love you more than yesterday 🫂💕. I never thought of having my love and sending wishes to her on Valentine’s Day, but all this happened because of you 💖. When you had a tough call to take this love and still chose to love me, it’s not just a simple thing to do. For me, a girl loving me is not a simple thing 🤗💗. I just don’t want to make this day complicated. This day and this message have to fill your heart with love 🤍. Some tough times may come and go, but we together will face them. I’m not leaving you alone even when I’m mad at you 🫂💕. As I said, whatever the wind brings us, we together take breaths 🫂❤️. It’s all about togetherness 🥰. I love you, thangapula 🤍 I’ll do it forever 💕. Just hold my hands and wait for me 🤗. One day I’ll take you to our wedding ❤️🫳🏻. These missing days will be filled with 100 times happiness in every day I spend with you 💗. Your wins are celebrated by people, and I’ll be there, and if you lose, I’ll be the first person to take care of you ❤️. If people go tough on you, come to me ✨️. Even if I become tough on you, tell me that it hurts you 🫂. If I do something wrong, yell at me, scold me, but don’t leave me. I can barely spend one day without you 💯🥺🫂. From the day I met you, like the day I fell in love with you, I’m waiting for you. I’ve been searching for you in every notification 🫂💕. So if I’m wrong, correct me I’ll change myself 🫂🤍. I still want to know how you want to be loved ❤️🫳🏻. Hold my hand; I’ll take care of you forever 💕. Have a great year ahead ✨️. I want to see you win and see your wishes come true ✨️. Happy Valentine’s Day, Nandhini 💖 Miss you 🫂 I love you, papa 🤍 Ummah 😘 Ummah 😘 One last thing to say 🚶🏻 it is Uuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😘😘😘🫂🫂🫂🤍🤍🤍 <br />-Your Inba💕</p>
